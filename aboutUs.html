as every fold has to be done with precision.</p>

after Buddhist monks from China carried paper to Japan during the 6th century. The monks recorded their use of Zhezhi as early
as 200 AD. The first Japanese origami was used for religious ceremonial purposes only, due to the high price of paper.</p>
